## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Desktop-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned how to make it so that an absolutely positioned element can overflow from a parent that has overflow set to hidden by basically positioning it to an element that doesn't have an overflow of hidden.

### Continued development

I plan to use this as an inspiration for my future projects.

### Useful resources

- [CSS Tricks article about popping hidden overflow](https://css-tricks.com/popping-hidden-overflow/) - This article helped me figure out how to make it so that the share-popup element properly overflows.
